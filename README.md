# usage

this is a bash shell script for Debian based systems (written on kubuntu), that should work with similar distros.

it's primary use is a fun way to learn commands by reading then typing the first few letters.

I tried to make it pretty by using lolcat to animate.

I need to automate the instalation of some of the components especally asciiquarium.
